# Hypothesis-Testing-on-Late-Medical-Shipments
Z test and t test for two different claims. 

# Scenario 1: 

# Hypotheses
---
Null Hypothesis (H0): The proportion of late shipments is 6%. Formally, 
H0:
p=0.06
---
Alternative Hypothesis (HA): The proportion of late shipments is not 6%. Formally, 
HA:
pâ‰ 0.06
---

# Scenario 2: 

# Why are 6% shipments late? Is weight associated to it?
# Claim: weight more , shipment late. Weight less, shipment not late
---
# H0: The mean weight of shipments that weren't late is the same as the mean weight of shipments that were late.
---
# Ha: The mean weight of shipments that weren't late is less than the mean weight of shipments that were late.
