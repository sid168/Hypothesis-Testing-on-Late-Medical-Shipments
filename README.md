# Hypothesis-Testing-on-Late-Medical-Shipments
<br><br>

The late_shipments dataset contains supply chain data on the delivery of medical supplies. Each row represents one delivery of a part. The late columns denotes whether or not the part was delivered late. A value of "Yes" means that the part was delivered late, and a value of "No" means the part was delivered on time.

Z test and t test for two different claims. 

# Scenario 1: 

# Hypotheses
---
Null Hypothesis (H0): The proportion of late shipments is 6%. Formally, 
H0:
p=0.06
---
Alternative Hypothesis (HA): The proportion of late shipments is not 6%. Formally, 
HA:
pâ‰ 0.06
---

# Scenario 2: 

# Why are 6% shipments late? Is weight associated to it?
# Claim: weight more , shipment late. Weight less, shipment not late
---
# H0: The mean weight of shipments that weren't late is the same as the mean weight of shipments that were late.
---
# Ha: The mean weight of shipments that weren't late is less than the mean weight of shipments that were late.
